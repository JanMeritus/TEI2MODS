                    History through the combination of traditional scholarly editing with cutting edge digital

                    selection of letters was governed by the notion of what would work best in the
                    high school and college classroom, especially in terms of length and
                    readability.

                        <lb/>only be characterized as disrespectful, arbitrary, and unconstitutional. The freedom

                        <lb/>nature and bearings will satisfy most men that it ought to come to an end; 
                        <lb/>and, further, that there is no more danger in bringing it to an end im-
                        <lb/>mediately, than there is in terminating any other act or system of injustice. 
                        <lb/>Abolitionists contend that the right of property in man ought to cease 
                        <lb/>without delay; and that the rights and duties of the slave should be re-
                        <lb/>mitted to the custody of the law. They seek to bring about this result 
                        <lb/>by addressing themselves to the mind &amp; heart of the people both in &amp; out of the 
                        <lb/>slaveholding communities. They are encouraged by the history of the last 
                        <lb/>fifty years in believing that all social evils have an ultimate &amp; sure remedy 
                        <lb/>in the power of public opinion, when it becomes sufficiently enlightened. At 
                        <lb/>the right state of this opinion the necessary legislation on the part of the 
                        <lb/>Slaveholding States will follow as a matter of course. But so far as 
                        <lb/>Slavery is a national evil it admits of &amp; requires a national remedy. 
                        <lb/>The non-Slaveholding States are responsible for its existence in the <placeName ref="#dc">Dis-
                        <lb/>trict of Columbia</placeName> to the extent respectively of their representative power in 
                        <lb/><name>Congress</name>; and they can only be relieved from this responsibility, when Slavery 
                        <lb/>&amp; the Slave-Trade, so far as they fall within the range of national legisla-
                        <lb/>tion, shall have become extinct; and the sooner they are relieved the better.</p>

                            <lb/>always been in fact; and, if Members of <name>Congress</name> will do their duty, by sus-

                        <lb/>and, as necessary consequences, shall a preponderance be secured to the Slave 
                        <lb/>States, the day of emancipation be indefinitely postponed, and a perpetual lease 
                        <lb/>be extended to a noxious and fearful institution, which will thus be fast-
                        <lb/>ened upon the vitals of the country?  In such a question both philanthro-
